# opmod
This mod is over-powered. It makes the player stronger, and the enemy weaker.

<br>

**WARNING:**

This is a powerful cheat mod. It should only be used in cases where you really get stuck on a certain map, and need some serious help, in order to defeat the map in question.

<br>

**Feature List:**

1. Health of all enemy units have been reduced to 1.

2. Armor of all enemy units have been reduced to 0. 

3. The health count of all in-game wall blocks have been reduced to 1.

4. New wall blocks have been introduced for the player, with health = 99,000.
   These new wall blocks are not used by the enemy on attack maps.

5. New turrets have been introduced for the player. These turrets have strong punching power, and they are not used by the enemy on any attack map, obviously.

6. The build speed of all blocks have been increased to FAST (tm).

7. The build cost of most blocks have been reduced to 1 copper.

8. The cost to launch all Core types to a new sector has been reduced to 1 copper.

9. The required ammo types for most turrets were changed, in order to render the enemy turrets
   useless and out-of-ammo on pre-built (in-game) attack maps.
   These attack maps were previously designed with the original ammo types in mind. (lol)

10. Item sources are available at the cost of 1 copper each.

11. Liquid sources are available at the cost of 1 copper each.

12. Sources for unlimited energy (power) are available at the cost of 1 copper each.

14. The cost of the unit factory is zero.

15. The per-unit cost of building units is zero.

16. The per-unit construction speed is 1.5 seconds.

17. One new ground unit has been introduced for the benefit of the player, with health = 99,000.

18. Seven new flying units were introduced for the benefit of the player. All 7 are strong and powerful.

19. Most components on the Tech Tree are unlocked by default, from the start of the game.
    Therefore, there is no need for the player to ever gather resources, in order to unlock these components.

20. The mod contains +/- 160 json text files.

21. The mod contains +/- 30 png graphics files, called sprites.

22. This mod can be used to conquer all the sectors on the whole planet, with relatively little effort.

**End of list.**
